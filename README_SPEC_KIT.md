# Project Connect with GitHub Spec Kit

This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Spec Kit to implement Project Connect's extended platform features, including the Task Completion Agents API.

## What is GitHub Spec Kit?

GitHub Spec Kit is a toolkit for practicing **Spec-Driven Development** - an approach that makes specifications the core of the development process, treating them as executable artifacts rather than static documents.

## How This Repository Uses Spec Kit

This repository follows the Spec-Driven Development approach by:

1. **Starting with Specifications**: All development begins with detailed specifications
2. **Making Specs Executable**: Specifications guide implementation directly
3. **Ensuring Consistency**: Cross-artifact analysis ensures alignment between specs and implementation
4. **Maintaining Quality**: Built-in review checklists validate both specs and implementations

## Project Structure Following Spec Kit Principles

```

## Getting Started with Spec Kit

### 1. Install Specify CLI

First, install the Spec Kit CLI tool:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

Note: You'll need `uv` installed. If you don't have it, install it from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv

### 2. Initialize a New Project

Create a new project using Spec Kit:

```bash
specify init project-connect-extension
cd project-connect-extension
```

### 3. Establish Project Principles

Create a constitution that guides all development decisions:

```bash
# Create constitution file
echo "# Project Connect Constitution
This document establishes our fundamental principles..." > constitution/CONSTITUTION.md
```

### 4. Create Detailed Specifications

Develop comprehensive specifications before implementation:

```bash
# Create API specification
echo "# Task Completion Agents API Specification
This specification defines the API for..." > specifications/API_SPEC.md
```

### 5. Generate Implementation Plans

Create implementation plans based on specifications:

```bash
# Create implementation plan
echo "# Implementation Plan
This document outlines the step-by-step..." > plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

### 6. Execute Implementation

Follow the implementation plan to build the actual system:

```bash
# Begin implementation based on specifications
mkdir src
# Start coding based on specifications...
```

## Benefits of Using Spec Kit for Project Connect

### 1. **Structured Development Process**

Spec Kit provides a clear, step-by-step approach:
- Intent-driven development (define "what" before "how")
- Multi-step refinement rather than one-shot implementation
- Rich specification creation with guardrails

### 2. **Executable Specifications**

Instead of static documentation:
- Specifications directly generate working implementations
- Consistency between docs and code is maintained
- Changes to specifications automatically propagate

### 3. **Quality Assurance**

Built-in quality mechanisms:
- Cross-artifact analysis ensures consistency
- Review checklists validate specifications and implementations
- Constitution files establish guiding principles

### 4. **API-First Development**

Natural progression to API-first approach:
- APIs are designed and documented before implementation
- Specifications include data models and API contracts
- Implementation follows directly from documented specifications

## Working with This Repository

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Didier1111/connect.git
   cd connect
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-agents
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here" > .env
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Contributing Following Spec Kit Principles

We welcome contributions that follow the Spec-Driven Development approach:

### 1. **Start with Specifications**
Always begin by updating or creating specifications before writing code.

### 2. **Follow the Constitution**
Ensure all contributions align with our guiding principles.

### 3. **Maintain Consistency**
Keep specifications, plans, and implementations aligned.

### 4. **Review Thoroughly**
Use checklists to validate both specifications and implementations.
