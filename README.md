# Project Connect

Project Connect is building the framework for viral, monetized open-source teams with equitable remuneration for all contributors.

## About

We're creating a new model for open-source collaboration that:
- Goes viral through exceptional community building
- Generates sustainable revenue through multiple streams
- Equitably rewards all contributors based on their impact
- Fosters inclusive, diverse, and thriving communities

This repository contains our framework, implementation plans, and resources for building this new model of open-source collaboration.

## Our Vision

Traditional open-source projects struggle with sustainability and contributor retention. Project Connect is developing a replicable model that solves these issues by:

1. **Viral Growth**: Creating communities that naturally attract and retain contributors
2. **Monetization**: Implementing sustainable revenue streams that support the project
3. **Equitable Rewards**: Ensuring all contributors are fairly compensated for their work
4. **Scalable Governance**: Building flat, inclusive governance structures that scale
