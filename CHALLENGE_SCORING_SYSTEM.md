# Challenge Scoring System & Revenue Sharing Model

This document provides detailed specifications for the challenge scoring system and revenue sharing model for Project Connect's trading journal platform.

## Challenge Scoring System

### Core Scoring Components

#### 1. Profitability Score (30% weight)
Measures risk-adjusted returns and trading efficiency

**Metrics:**
- Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio equivalent)
- Win Rate (Percentage of profitable trades)
- Average Win/Loss Ratio
- Total Return vs. Benchmark

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Profitability Score = (
  (RiskAdjustedReturn / BenchmarkRAR * 0.4) +
  (WinRate / BenchmarkWinRate * 0.3) +
  (WinLossRatio / BenchmarkWLR * 0.2) +
  (TotalReturn / BenchmarkReturn * 0.1)
) * 30
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Risk-Adjusted Return: 1.0 (minimum acceptable)
- Win Rate: 50% (for 1:1 R/R trades)
- Win/Loss Ratio: 1.5:1
- Total Return: Market benchmark

#### 2. Consistency Score (25% weight)
Measures steady performance and discipline

**Metrics:**
- Positive Period Streak (consecutive profitable weeks)
- Downside Volatility (consistency of returns)
- Drawdown Frequency (number of drawdown periods)
- Recovery Time (time to recover from drawdowns)

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Consistency Score = (
  (StreakLength / MaxStreak * 0.3) +
  (1 - (DownsideVolatility / BenchmarkVol * 0.3)) +
  (1 - (DrawdownFrequency / BenchmarkFreq * 0.2)) +
  (1 - (AvgRecoveryTime / BenchmarkRecovery * 0.2))
) * 25
```

#### 3. Risk Management Score (25% weight)
Measures adherence to risk controls

**Metrics:**
- Maximum Drawdown Control
- Position Sizing Discipline
- Stop-Loss Adherence
- Correlation Risk Management

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Risk Management Score = (
  (1 - (MaxDrawdown / MaxAcceptableDD * 0.4)) +
  (PositionSizingAccuracy / 100 * 0.3) +
  (StopLossAdherence / 100 * 0.2) +
  (1 - (PortfolioCorrelation / MaxCorrelation * 0.1))
) * 25
```

#### 4. Adaptability Score (20% weight)
Measures performance across different market conditions

**Metrics:**
- Performance in Bull Markets
- Performance in Bear Markets
- Performance in Sideways Markets
- Strategy Diversification

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Adaptability Score = (
  (BullMarketPerformance / Benchmark * 0.3) +
  (BearMarketPerformance / Benchmark * 0.3) +
  (SidewaysMarketPerformance / Benchmark * 0.2) +
  (StrategyDiversification / MaxDiversification * 0.2)
) * 20

### Revenue Distribution Algorithm

```
User Share = Base Percentage + 
             (Performance Bonus × Tier Multiplier) + 
             (Activity Bonus × Participation Rate)

Where:
- Base Percentage: Tier-based percentage of revenue pool
- Performance Bonus: Points above tier threshold × 0.1%
- Tier Multiplier: 1.0 for Bronze, 1.2 for Silver, 1.5 for Gold, 2.0 for Platinum
- Activity Bonus: Number of active challenges × 0.05%
- Participation Rate: (Challenges completed / Challenges available) × 100%
```

### Example Calculation

**User Profile:**
- Tier: Gold (15% base)
- Performance Points: 85 (5 points above Gold threshold)
- Active Challenges: 3
- Participation Rate: 75% (3/4 challenges)

**Revenue Share Calculation:**
```
Base Share = 15% of revenue pool
Performance Bonus = 5 points × 0.1% = 0.5%
Tier Multiplier = 1.5
Performance Share = 0.5% × 1.5 = 0.75%
Activity Bonus = 3 challenges × 0.05% = 0.15%
Participation Multiplier = 75% = 0.75
Activity Share = 0.15% × 0.75 = 0.1125%

Total Share = 15% + 0.75% + 0.1125% = 15.8625%
```
