# Project Connect Task Completion Agents API Specification

This specification defines the API for the Task Completion Agents platform, enabling task delegation, agent management, and revenue sharing.

## Overview

The Task Completion Agents API provides endpoints for managing tasks, agents, contracts, and payments within the Project Connect ecosystem. It enables contributors to delegate tasks to specialized agents while maintaining equitable revenue sharing.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Task Management
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Categorize tasks by type and skill requirements
- Set budgets and timelines
- Track task status and progress

### 2. Agent Management
- Register and manage agent profiles
- Verify agent skills and expertise
- Track agent performance and ratings
- Categorize agents by type (human, AI, hybrid)

### 3. Contract System
- Create smart contracts between contributors and agents
- Define payment terms and milestones
- Track contract execution and completion
- Handle dispute resolution

### 4. Payment Processing
- Process payments for completed milestones
- Distribute revenue according to sharing agreements
- Generate tax reports and compliance documents
- Support multiple payment methods

### 5. Matching System
- Match tasks with appropriate agents based on skills
- Optimize matching based on performance history
- Consider availability and cost factors
- Provide recommendation engine
