5. **Payout Processing**: Execute payments
6. **Reporting**: Generate reports for users and administrators

#### Payout Calculation Formula
```javascript
function calculatePayout(user, revenuePool) {
  // Base percentage based on tier
  const baseShare = user.tier.basePercentage;
  
  // Performance bonus
  const performanceBonus = Math.max(0, user.points - user.tier.minPoints) * 0.1;
  const tierMultiplier = user.tier.multiplier;
  const performanceShare = performanceBonus * tierMultiplier;
  
  // Activity bonus
  const activityBonus = user.activeChallenges * 0.05;
  const participationRate = user.completedChallenges / user.totalChallenges;
  const activityShare = activityBonus * participationRate;
  
  // Total share percentage
  const totalShare = baseShare + performanceShare + activityShare;
  
  // Actual payout amount
  const payout = revenuePool * (totalShare / 100);
  
  return {
    baseAmount: revenuePool * (baseShare / 100),
    performanceAmount: revenuePool * (performanceShare / 100),
