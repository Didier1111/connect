# Simple ICT-Based Trading Strategy

This document outlines a straightforward trading strategy that combines support/resistance analysis with ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts to capture early liquidity moves and trend continuation.

## Strategy Overview

**Name**: ICT Liquidity Capture Strategy
**Timeframe**: 4-hour and Daily charts
**Markets**: Forex, Indices, Commodities
**Approach**: Structural analysis focusing on key levels and institutional behavior

## Core Concepts

### 1. Support and Resistance Identification
- **Support**: Areas where buying pressure exceeds selling pressure
- **Resistance**: Areas where selling pressure exceeds buying pressure
- **Key Levels**: Previous day highs/lows, round numbers, psychological levels

### 2. ICT Concepts Applied
- **Fair Value Gap (FVG)**: Imbalance between buyers and sellers
- **Liquidity Void**: Areas where price moves rapidly with little reaction
- **Order Blocks**: Institutional order placement zones
- **Mitigation Blocks**: Areas that invalidate previous structures

### 3. Liquidity Targets
- **Range Extension**: Measured moves from key levels
- **Trend Continuation**: Following institutional momentum
- **Structural Breaks**: Key level breaches with volume confirmation

## Strategy Rules

### Entry Setup
1. **Identify Key Levels**
   - Mark previous day's high/low
   - Identify round numbers and psychological levels
   - Locate areas of institutional interest

2. **Wait for Structural Signal**
   - Price approaches key support/resistance level
   - Formation of FVG near key level
   - Order block identification

3. **Entry Trigger**
   - Break of structure with momentum
   - Inside bar or false move pattern
   - Volume confirmation (if available)

### Entry Execution
- **Buy Signal**: 
  - Price breaks above resistance with momentum
  - FVG below current price
  - Confirmation candle closes above broken level
  
- **Sell Signal**: 
  - Price breaks below support with momentum
  - FVG above current price
  - Confirmation candle closes below broken level

### Stop Loss Placement
- **Conservative**: Beyond recent swing high/low
- **Aggressive**: Beyond identified order block
- **Fixed**: 1-2% of account equity

### Take Profit Targets
1. **First Target (Liquidity Capture)**: 
   - 1:1 Risk/Reward ratio
   - Measured move from entry to nearest key level

2. **Second Target (Trend Extension)**:
   - 1:2 Risk/Reward ratio
   - Follow trend momentum with trailing stops

3. **Third Target (Structural Extension)**:
   - 1:3+ Risk/Reward ratio
   - Until next key structural level

## Strategy Application

### Pre-Market Analysis
1. **Daily Chart Review**
   - Mark previous day's high, low, and close
   - Identify key support/resistance levels
   - Locate significant FVGs from previous sessions

2. **4-Hour Chart Setup**

   - Identify order blocks from recent price action
   - Mark potential entry zones

### Intraday Execution
1. **Level Monitoring**

   - Look for institutional behavior patterns
   - Monitor volume (if available)

2. **Entry Confirmation**
   - Wait for structural break confirmation
   - Enter on momentum confirmation candle
   - Place stop loss immediately

3. **Position Management**
   - Take partial profits at first target
   - Move stop to breakeven at second target
   - Trail stop on remaining position

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **Fixed Percentage**: 1-2% of account per trade
- **Volatility Adjusted**: Smaller positions in volatile markets
- **Correlation Adjusted**: Reduce exposure to correlated pairs

### Trade Management
