## Our Mission

Project Connect is revolutionizing open-source collaboration by creating **self-sustaining communities** where **every contributor is fairly compensated** for their impact. We're building the future of work where passion, skill, and community converge to create value for everyone involved.

## Why Project Connect Exists

Traditional open-source projects struggle with three critical challenges:
- **Sustainability** - Lack of funding leads to abandoned projects
- **Contributor Retention** - Talented contributors leave for paid opportunities

Project Connect solves these issues by creating **viral, monetized communities** with **transparent revenue sharing** that benefits everyone.
