## Project Overview

### What is Project Connect?
Project Connect is building the framework for viral, monetized open-source teams with equitable remuneration for all contributors.

We're creating a new model for open-source collaboration that solves traditional sustainability and contributor retention issues by:
- **Going viral** through exceptional community building
- **Generating sustainable revenue** through multiple streams
- **Equitably rewarding** all contributors based on their impact
- **Fostering inclusive, diverse, and thriving communities**

### Our Vision
Traditional open-source projects struggle with:
- **Sustainability**: Most projects lack long-term funding
- **Contributor Retention**: Talented contributors often leave for paid opportunities
- **Equitable Rewards**: Contributions are rarely financially rewarded proportionally
- **Community Growth**: Building and maintaining vibrant communities is difficult

Project Connect addresses these challenges by creating communities that:
- **Go Viral**: Through exceptional community building strategies
- **Generate Revenue**: Through sustainable monetization approaches
- **Equitably Reward**: All contributors based on their impact
- **Foster Communities**: That are inclusive, diverse, and thriving
